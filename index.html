            <h2>MY STORY</h2>
            <p>
                I have been working as a bell attendant for 3 years of my university. <br>
                If you traveled to somewhere you could see what the bell attendant do.<br>
                Just do some craft work and take the fucking tips from the guests.<br>
                Now I am still a Bell Attendant but I am trying to be a software engineer.<br>
                I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For my roadmap that is to be come Frontend Developer<br>
                and then Backend Developer.<br>
                I am trying to learn how to use Git and Github. You can check my Git umh well it quite stupit ^=^<br>
                I am also looking for a job in the field of web development. If you know any companies that are hiring, please let me know (just when i finish the scrimba Course). <br>

                <h2>Why I want to learn the new Skill?</h2>
            
                   As i mentioned above, I am a bell attendant. I have to work at night and study in the morning.<br>
                   Or somethimes it swichted to the opposite.<br>
                   i just wonder why i become introvert and don't want to go out.<br>
                   the second reason is that i have nothing to create the product that i want.<br>
                   i am feeling like "i am a slave" in that job because i have to serve some asshole <br>
                   who don't know how to respect the others.<br>
                   I am not saying that all of the guests are like that but most of them are.<br>
                   So these are the reasons why i want to learn the new skill.<br>
                   My target is to finish the Scrimba Course "frontend developer career path" and then i will apply for a job or maybe i have some money from crypto then i will stayhome and work ^=^.<br>
                   Okay that is all for now. <br>
                   I have to go to work now. I will update this blog when i have time.<br>
                   Thank you = Cảm ơn bạn đã đọc bài viết này.<br>
